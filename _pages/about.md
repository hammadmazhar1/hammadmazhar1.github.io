Hi, I am M. Hammad Mazhar, currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Northern Colorado. I received my PhD. in Computer Science from the University of Iowa in 2023 under supervision of [Dr. Omar Chowdhury](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~omar/) (currently at Stony Brook University). I received my BSc. in Computer Science from the Lahore University of Management Sciences [LUMS](https://www.lums.edu.pk), Pakistan in 2016.

Research Interests
======
My current research focuses on resolving security and privacy issues in programmable IoT systems such as smart homes. My thesis proposed the *safety problem* in programmable IoT systems with a formal definition and proposes a tractable solution using a platform-agnostic policy-enforcement system  [(WiSec 2023)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3558482.3590188). My prior research encompasses a wide range of work such as studying insecure Wi-Fi configurations [(CCS 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3460120.3484569), a study on smart home IoT traffic in the wild [(IoTDI 2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9097598), video QoE monitoring for encrypted video streaming [(INFOCOM 2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8486321).
